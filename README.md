# unicorn-rs
Rust bindings for the [unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org/) CPU emulator.

```rust
extern crate unicorn;

use unicorn::{Unicorn, uc_handle};

fn main() {
    let x86_code32 : Vec<u8> = vec![0x41, 0x4a]; // INC ecx; DEC edx

    let emu = Unicorn::new(unicorn::Arch::X86, unicorn::Mode::MODE_32).expect("failed to instantiate emulator");
    emu.mem_map(0x1000, 0x4000, unicorn::PROT_ALL); 
    emu.mem_write(0x1000, &x86_code32); 
    emu.reg_write_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::ECX as i32, -10);
    emu.reg_write_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::EDX as i32, -50);

    emu.emu_start(0x1000, (0x1000 + x86_code32.len()) as u64, 10 * unicorn::SECOND_SCALE, 1000);
    assert_eq!(emu.reg_read_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::ECX as i32), Ok((-9)));
    assert_eq!(emu.reg_read_i32(unicorn::RegisterX86::EDX as i32), Ok((-51)));
}
```

## Installation

To test this project please follow these steps :

1. Download and build and install unicorn normally with the `make.sh` and `make.sh install`. 
2. Clone this project, `cd unicorn-rs` and `cargo build`.
3. `cargo test` to make sure it works as expected.

## Notes

The bindings do not currently support callbacks for tracing interrupts and IN/OUT instructions for x86. Please create
an issue (or a pull request) if this something you would like to be added.
